I’ve joined this competition as my first one. My goal was to get to know a little bit more about machine learning and its difference from Econometrics. At this point, I have taken the Andrew Ng Coursera’s course and I have realized that the these two areas of knowledge have a lot in common. The most surprising was that I’ve alread had contact with more than 80% of the course’s content while working with Econometrics and Multivariate Analysis.

This Rnotebook has been produced few months ago. My rank today, 2019/10/26, is top 13%. I beleieve it’s not bad for a first contact to Machine Learning. The main point, for me, it is that I have learned a lot doing this competition!

OBS: I'm still trying to figure out how to improve my GitHub's layout and navigability and trying. Meanwhile, you can check the report out at https://guiotto.github.io/Kaggle-Titanic/.
